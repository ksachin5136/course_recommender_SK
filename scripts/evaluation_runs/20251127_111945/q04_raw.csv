C009,Containerization with Docker and Kubernetes,"Learn container fundamentals with Docker: images, containers, and Compose. Then advance to Kubernetes for orchestration: pods, deployments, services, and ingress. This course covers cluster provisioning, autoscaling, rolling updates, and Helm chart packaging. Hands-on labs deploy microservices architectures on a local or cloud-based Kubernetes cluster, ensuring reliability, scalability, and streamlined DevOps workflows.",0.464
C007,Cloud Computing with Azure,"Master Microsoft Azure’s core services: virtual machines, Azure Functions, Azure SQL Database, Cosmos DB, and Azure Kubernetes Service. Learn to deploy scalable web applications, configure networking and security, and implement infrastructure-as-code with ARM templates. Hands-on labs guide you through resource provisioning, cost management, and best practices for high availability and disaster recovery in Azure.",0.0
C010,APIs and Microservices Architecture,"Design and implement RESTful and GraphQL APIs using Node.js, Express, or Python FastAPI. Learn microservices patterns: service discovery, circuit breakers, and API gateways. Topics include containerized deployment, versioning strategies, and security best practices (OAuth2, JWT). Labs guide you through building, testing, and deploying interconnected services, enabling scalable, maintainable distributed systems.",0.0
C025,MLOps: Productionizing Machine Learning,"Master the practices needed to deploy and maintain ML models at scale. Topics include model versioning with MLflow, containerization, CI/CD for ML, monitoring with Prometheus, and data drift detection. You’ll build end-to-end pipelines that automate training, testing, deployment, and governance, ensuring robust, reproducible, and compliant machine learning systems in production environments.",0.0
C002,Deep Learning with TensorFlow and Keras,"Explore neural network architectures using TensorFlow and Keras frameworks. This course covers feedforward networks, convolutional neural networks, recurrent neural networks, and transfer learning. Learn to build, train, evaluate, and optimize deep learning models for image classification, sequence modeling, and text processing. Includes hands-on labs and real-world project implementations with interactive exercises.",0.0
